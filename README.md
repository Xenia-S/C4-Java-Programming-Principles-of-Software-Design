# [Java Programming: Principles of Software Design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-design-principles?specialization=java-programming)

This course is offered at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and is a fourth course of the [Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming).

## IMPORTANT NOTE:

Some code should be run in a custom Bluej Development Environment designed by educators at the University of Kent. You can get the IDE from the [Duke University website](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//downloads/bluej.php?course=2).

I finished the course on August 30, 2022, here's the [Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/f923bc0676474652fc550ab9a39059d8).

### What I learned in this course:
1. Use sorting appropriately in solving problems;
2. Develop classes that implement the Comparable interface;
3. Use timing data to analyze empirical performance;
4. Break problems into multiple classes, each with their own methods;
5. Determine if a class from the Java API can be used in solving a particular problem;
6. Implement programming solutions using multiple approaches and recognize tradeoffs;
7. Use object-oriented concepts including interfaces and abstract classes when developing programs;
8. Appropriately hide implementation decisions so they are not visible in public methods; and
9. Recognize the limitations of algorithms and Java programs in solving problems.
10. Recognize standard Java classes and idioms including exception-handling, static methods, java.net, and java.io packages.
